This is the original Gita, the first edition inserted into Jaya. The conversation between Arjuna and Krishna is straightforward, and makes perfect sense. The battle is about to begin and Arjuna the Warrior Prince has lost his nerve. Krishna puts forth arguments directing him to action. This text has few philosophical discussions. Krishna is very precise, in the role of a coach, simply pointing out that it Arjuna is duty bound to fight according to the Warrior Code. He warns him of the infamy he will incur if he flees from the battlefield, and advises him to disassociate his actions from his feelings and focus on the task at hand. Arjuna's despair is dispelled, he thanks Krishna for his timely advice, and promises to act accordingly. That's it.
We will discuss how this conversation was pieced together in the next episode.
